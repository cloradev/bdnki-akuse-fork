# Other info

  <summary><h2>⚙️ Running locally for development</h2></summary>

Start cloning akuse:

```
git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/akuse.git
```

Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
As Redirect Uri, you can insert `akuse://index,https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin` (these are two space seprated uri) and it should work.
Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.ts file with a structure like this:

```bash
import { ClientData } from "../types/types";

export const clientData: ClientData = {
  clientId: ,
  redirectUri: "",
  clientSecret: "",
};
```

Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.

```bash
# Example:
import { ClientData } from "../types/types";

export const clientData: ClientData = {
  clientId: 12345,
  redirectUri: 'akuse://index',
  clientSecret: 'iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv',
};
```

Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):

```
npm install
```

To start, run:

```
npm start
```

  <summary><h2>⚠ How to Log-In in AppImage & Development</h2></summary>

In AppImage and in a Development environment, the Log-In redirect doesn't work since the app is not packed/installed. If you need to work with an authenticated instance, follow these steps:

1. open the app using one of the method e.g.

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   or

   ```
   ./path/to/app.AppImage
   ```

2. Now click on the login button and authenticate in the browser. Next, copy the code you are given, go back to akuse and click the navbar element with a laptop icon. Here you can paste your code.

3. Finally, paste your code and push the button. If the code you entered is correct, you are now Logged-in, othwerise repeat these steps and see what has gone wrong.

**NOTE:** This is not needed in Installed App.
